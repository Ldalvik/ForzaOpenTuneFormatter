    <h1>Welcome to OPTN!</h1>
    <p>
      An online Forza community dedicated to helping others.
      Our mission is to simplify tuning, put it in the simplest terms possible
      and help new tuners get their feet wet and discover the potential of a car.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website hosts many tools to help toward this, but the most effective way to interact is through our

    <h2>Bi-Weekly Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      We host bi-weekly challenges through Forza Rivals mode.
      Follow the current restrictions (specific car, category or even other fun restrictions)
      and try to be the fastest! Our community will do its best to help you improve both your
      driving and how you build and tune your cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Challenges are posted every second Monday on
      <a
        :href="Urls.DiscordInvite"
        target="_blank"

      </a>
      which is also where tunes must be posted to be eligible to win.
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenges are designed to be different,
      and more often than not push tuners outside their comfort zone to grow both their tuning
      and driving skills. Join the

    <h2>Tuning Guide</h2>
    <p>
      We have a
      <a
        :href="Urls.TuningGuide"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >
        Tuning Guide
      </a>
      (Google Docs)
      available with nearly everything
      you need to know about tuning. Tuning is quite a deep subject, don't try to understand
      everything at once!  Start with the basics,
      use the <RouterLink :to="{ name: 'tuningchart' }">Tuning Chart</RouterLink> for troubleshooting,
      and don't hesitate to ask help from the pros on our Discord server.
    </p>

    <h2>Tune Formatter</h2>
    <p>
      The most important tools are our Setup Formatters for
      <RouterLink :to="{ name: 'formatter-fh5', params: { version: 'v1' } }">Forza Horizon 5</RouterLink>
      and
      <RouterLink :to="{ name: 'formatter-fm8', params: { version: 'v3' } }">Forza Motorsport (2023)</RouterLink>.
      OPTN in fact means “Open Tuning”, as this community is built on sharing open source tunes.
      Forza games lock the tunes so when you download it from someone else, you can't see exactly
      what the original tuner did to the car or edit it. The Tune Formatter was created as a workaround to this problem.
